<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), [supervised by Dr. Xin Huang](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xinhuang/index.html). In 2024, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Technology from Jinan University. Prior to that, I graduated from Shijiazhuang No. 2 High School in 2020.
